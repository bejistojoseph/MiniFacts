# 🌟 Welcome to Minifacts

Your daily dose of **amazing mini facts**, **life hacks**, and **clever tricks** – all packed into one beautifully designed website!

## 📖 About This Project

Minifacts is a fun and interactive website built to deliver bite-sized knowledge, productivity tips, and everyday hacks to curious minds. From quirky science facts to tech tricks and DIY ideas, there's something here for everyone.

This project started as a **demo experiment** – I received a **free domain** and thought, *“Why not build something useful and fun?”*

With the help of **AI tools** like:
- 💡 ChatGPT (for content, logic, and structure)
- 🧠 GitHub Copilot (for coding assistance)
- ✨ Lovable.ai (for UI generation and rapid prototyping)

...this project came to life quickly and creatively.
